Homework 3 for Coding Bootcamp

The task was to take a pre-made website, intended to generate a random password, and modify the javascript for the following:

  User input for password length between 8 - 128 characters
  
  User input for allowed characters (lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, special characters)
  
  Output a password specific to user input
  
Javascript should accept user input, attempt to randomize which character type to select from and then select a random character, and if randomization of character
type fails it should still randomize the character of whatever type it hits first.


Notes: I'm not sure why, but github pages will still accept decimal values as password lengths. This is appropriately handled from visual studio, I'm not sure what the issue is.
